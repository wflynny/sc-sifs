# Single Cell SIFs

This repo contains the definition files for several singularity image files
that contain 10X Genomics CellRanger and other tools used for Single Cell
genomics analyses.

## Basics

The two image bases that are used are `alpine` and `debian:buster-slim`.
Alpine is super useful for its very small uncompressed filesize, but from
experience it doesn't play nicely with Python due to its lack of glibc, so for
tools that rely on Python we use `debian:buster-slim` (a trimmed version of
Debian 10).
